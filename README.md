### The AI-free app icon generator

Create random app icons by dragging sliders, then save them at the following resolutions.  See some examples of designs that have been created by checking the Samples folder.

* 16x16
* 32x32
* 64x64
* 128x128
* 256x256
* 512x512
* 1024x1024

If you *generate an image* with this software I do not claim ownership of it now nor at any point in the future. That is your icon, do whatever you want with it. The code is covered by it's own license.

In the initial release you'll have to hit `cmd-s` to save an icon, but future versions will allow you to do this through the UI.
